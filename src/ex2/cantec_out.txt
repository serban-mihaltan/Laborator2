NEVER MADE IT AS A WISE MAN 7 10 
I COULDN'T CUT IT AS A POOR MAN STEALING 9 12 
Tired of living like a blind man 7 10 
I'm sick of sight without a sense of feeling 9 13 
And this is how you remind me 7 8 
This is how you remind me 6 8 
Of what I really am 5 4 
This is how you remind me 6 8 
OF WHAT I REALLY AM 5 4 
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU TO SAY "SORRY" 7 8 
I WAS WAITING ON A DIFFERENT STORY 7 10 
This time, I'm mistaken 4 6 
For handing you a heart worth breaking 7 12 
AND I'VE BEEN WRONG, I'VE BEEN DOWN 7 8 
Been to the bottom of every bottle 7 11 
THESE FIVE WORDS IN MY HEAD 6 8 
SCREAM, "ARE WE HAVING FUN YET?" 6 8 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no 5 8 
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, NO, NO 5 8 
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT 7 8 
I said, "I love you, " and I swear, I still do 12 11 
And it must have been so bad 7 8 
'Cause living with me must have damn near killed you 10 17 
AND THIS IS HOW YOU REMIND ME 7 8 
OF WHAT I REALLY AM 5 4 
This is how you remind me 6 8 
Of what I really am 5 4
